# neural-fuzzy
A neural-fuzzy system to balance inverted pendulum + GUI training interface.

Algorithm is based on: 

1. Yamakawa, T, “A fuzzy inference engine in nonlinear analog mode and its application to a fuzzy logic
   control.”, IEEE Trans. Neural Networks 4(3), pp. 496-522, 1993.
2. Nomura, H., Hayashi, I., and Wakami, N.: A self-tuning method of fuzzy control by descent method, in: Proc.
   of the 4th IFSA Congress, Brussels, 1991, pp. 155–158.
